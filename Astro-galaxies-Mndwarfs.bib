abstract = {Aims. Following our solar work, we perform NLTE calculations of the Mn abundance for fourteen stars with [Fe/H] from 0 to –2.5, mainly to show how NLTE affects Mn abundances in cool stars of different metallicities.Methods. The spectrum synthesis and Mn abundances are based on statistical equilibrium calculations using various estimates for the influence of hydrogen collisions.Results. The NLTE abundances of Mn in all studied stars are systematically higher than the LTE abundances. At low metallicities, the NLTE abundance corrections may run up to 0.5–0.7 dex. Instead of a strong depletion of Mn relative to Fe in metal-poor stars as found by the other authors, we only find slightly subsolar values of [Mn/Fe] throughout the range of metallicities analyzed here.Conclusions. The [Mn/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars is inconsistent with the predictions of galactic chemical evolution models, where Mn is less produced than Fe.},

abstract = {We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L{\_}sun) {\~{}}= 1.6, which can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform. Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] {\textless} +1 in dSphs follow a different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the metallicity of the [C/Fe] "knee" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe] distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.},

abstract = {We present measurements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti abundances for 388 radial velocity member stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), a satellite of the Milky Way. This is the largest sample of individual alpha element (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 A, R {\~{}} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R {\textgreater}{\~{}} 20000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties of sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.14 and sigma([alpha/Fe]) = 0.13. The Sculptor [Fe/H] distribution has a mean {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2 than the Milky Way halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 +/- 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except the Milky Way halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [alpha/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H] increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\~{}} -1.5) have lower [alpha/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 +/- 0.003 dex per arcmin in [Fe/H] and +0.013 +/- 0.003 dex per arcmin in [alpha/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc). Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor tail of the Galactic halo formed.},

abstract = {We present our analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) observations in F555W ({\~{}}V) and F814W ({\~{}}I) of the central region of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The V versus V-I color-magnitude diagram features a sparsely populated blue horizontal branch, a steep thin red giant branch, and a narrow subgiant branch. The main sequence reaches {\~{}}2 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff (V{\_}TO {\~{}} 23.27 +- 0.11 mag) of the median stellar population. We compare the fiducial sequence of Ursa Minor with the fiducial sequence of the Galactic globular cluster M92 (NGC 6341). The excellent match between Ursa Minor and M92 confirms that the median stellar population of the UMi dSph galaxy is metal poor ([Fe/H]{\_}UMi {\~{}} [Fe/H]{\_}M92 {\~{}} -2.2 dex) and ancient (age{\_}UMi {\~{}} age{\_}M92 {\~{}} 14 Gyr). The B-V reddening and the absorption in V are estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.03 +- 0.01 mag and A{\_}V = 0.09 +- 0.03 mag. A new estimate of the distance modulus of Ursa Minor, (m-M){\_}0 = 19.18 +- 0.12 mag, has been derived based on fiducial-sequence fitting with M92 and the adoption of the apparent V distance modulus for M92 of (m-M){\_}V = 14.67 +- 0.08 mag (Pont et al. 1998, A{\&}A, 329, 87). These HST observations indicate that Ursa Minor has had a very simple star formation history consisting mainly of a single major burst of star formation about 14 Gyr ago which lasted {\textless}=2 Gyr. If the ancient Galactic globular clusters, like M92, formed concurrently with the early formation of the Milky Way galaxy itself, then the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal is probably as old as the Milky Way.},

The volume and density of the white dwarf increase during slow subsonic burning, and this burning is transformed when certain critical conditions are met. The scenario is simulated numerically to give results of the gasdynamical event: all C-O fuel is burned; intermediate mass elements are produced in the outer layers; and approximately 1 solar mass or more of Fe-peak elements is produced during a delayed detonation. The results are compared to both detonation and deflagration models to consider the velocities of intermediate mass elements and of Fe-peak elements. The ratios obtained in the models are similar to those found in the solar neighborhood, and the detonation is shown to occur at low densities.},

abstract = {In the "double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar" model for type Ia supernovae, a carbon-oxygen (C + O) white dwarf accumulates sufficient amounts of helium such that a detonation ignites in that layer before the Chandrasekhar mass is reached. This detonation is thought to trigger a secondary detonation in the C + O core. By means of one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-M{\_}sun models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in numerical simulations is analyzed. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell masses of 0.2 and 0.1 M{\_}sun, we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete evolution of three selected models with 0.2 M{\_}sun of He through the C/O-detonation phase and obtain nickel-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M{\_}sun. Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta features significant amounts of nickel in the outer layers at high expansion velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra. (abbreviated)},

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

abstract = {Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were discovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are relatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause white dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single and/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions have different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar mass explosions.Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic chemical signatures.Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected to be rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker metallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution of metal-poor systems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor.Results. The model predicts a butterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity and – at the same time – a decrease of [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than in the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed abundances in stars of Ursa Minor.Conclusions. The surprising agreement between our models and available observations provides a strong indication of the origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia. This outcome requires confirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in stars of other satellite galaxies of our Milky Way. It will be vital for this project to measure not the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the opposite; the metal-rich end of dwarf spheroidals.},

abstract = {We provide manganese abundances (corrected for the effect of the hyperfine structure) for a large number of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, and for a smaller number in the Carina and Sextans dSph galaxies. Abundances had already been determined for a number of other elements in these galaxies, including $\alpha$ and iron-peak ones, which allowed us to build [Mn/Fe] and [Mn/$\alpha$] versus [Fe/H] diagrams. The Mn abundances imply sub-solar [Mn/Fe] ratios for the stars in all four galaxies examined. In Sculptor, [Mn/Fe] stays roughly constant between [Fe/H] ∼ −1.8 and −1.4 and decreases at higher iron abundance. In Fornax, [Mn/Fe] does not vary in any significant way with [Fe/H]. The relation between [Mn/$\alpha$] and [Fe/H] for the dSph galaxies is clearly systematically offset from that for the Milky Way, which reflects the different star formation histories of the respective galaxies. The [Mn/$\alpha$] behavior can be interpreted as a result of the metal-dependent Mn yields of Type II and Type Ia supernovae. We also computed chemical evolution models for star formation histories matching those determined empirically for Sculptor, Fornax, and Carina, and for the Mn yields of SNe Ia, which were assumed to be either constant or variable with metallicity. The observed [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in Sculptor, Fornax, and Carina can be reproduced only by the chemical evolution models that include a metallicity-dependent Mn yield from the SNe Ia.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from LTE whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

abstract = {Context. Manganese is predominantly synthesised in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive thermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass (M Ch) white dwarfs (WDs) are predicted to produce Mn-to-Fe ratios that significantly exceed those of SN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current supernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-M Ch WDs produce [Mn/Fe] 0.0. Aims. Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia scenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding near-M Ch to sub-M Ch primary WDs in the Galaxy. Methods. We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear supernova simulations that refer to different initial setups and progenitor channels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the solar neighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of the considered explosion models. Results. We find that due to the entropy dependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe] depends strongly on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-M Ch WDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-M Ch WDs. Of all nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of Mn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of near-M Ch WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe]. Consequently, we find in our chemical evolution calculations that the observed [Mn/Fe] in the solar neighborhood at [Fe/H] 0.0 cannot be reproduced without near-M Ch SN Ia primaries. Assuming that 50{\%} of all SNe Ia stem from explosive thermonuclear burning in near-M Ch WDs results in a good match to data.},

The very same explosive thermonuclear fusion event is also one of the major processes contributing to the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements, in particular the iron-group elements. For example, most of the iron and manganese in the Sun and its planetary system was produced in thermonuclear supernovae. Here, we review the physics of explosive thermonuclear burning in carbon-oxygen white dwarf material and the methodolo-gies utilized in calculating predicted nucleosynthesis from hydrodynamic explosion models. While the dominant explosion scenario remains unclear, many aspects of the nuclear combustion and nucleosynthesis are common to all models and must occur in some form in order to produce the observed yields. We summarize the predicted nucleosynthetic yields for existing explosions models, placing particular emphasis on characteristic differences in the nucleosynthetic signatures of the dif-ferent suggested scenarios leading to Type Ia supernovae. Following this, we discuss how these signatures compare with observations of several individual supernovae, remnants, and the composition of material in our Galaxy and galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {Barium stars are optimal sites for studying the correlations between the neutron-capture elements and other species that may be depleted or enhanced, because they act as neutron seeds or poisons during the operation of the s-process. These data are necessary to help constrain the modeling of the neutron-capture paths and explain the s-process abundance curve of the solar system. Chemical abundances for a large number of barium stars with different degrees of s-process excesses, masses, metallicities, and evolutionary states are a crucial step towards this goal. We present abundances of Mn, Cu, Zn, and various light and heavy elements for a sample of barium and normal giant stars, and present correlations between abundances contributed to different degrees by the weak-s, mains , and r-processes of neutron capture, between Fe-peak elements and heavy elements. Data from the literature are also considered in order to better study the abundance pattern of peculiar stars. The stellar spectra were observed with FEROS/ESO. The stellar atmospheric parameters of the eight barium giant stars and six normal giants that we analyzed lie in the range 4300 {\textless} T eff /K {\textless} 5300, −0.7 {\textless} [Fe/H] ≤ 0.12 and 1.5 ≤ log g {\textless} 2.9. Carbon and nitrogen abundances were derived by spectral synthesis of the molecular bands of C 2 , CH, and CN. For all other elements we used the atomic lines to perform the spectral synthesis. A very large scatter was found mainly for the Mn abundances when data from the literature were considered. We found that [Zn/Fe] correlates well with the heavy element excesses, its abundance clearly increasing as the heavy element excesses increase, a trend not shown by the [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also, the ratios involving Mn, Cu, and Zn and heavy elements usually show an increasing trend toward higher metallicities. Our results suggest that a larger fraction of the Zn synthesis than of Cu is owed to massive stars, and that the contribution of the mains process to the synthesis of both elements is small. We also conclude that Mn is mostly synthesized by SN Ia, and that a non-negligible fraction of the synthesis of Mn, Cu, and Zn is owed to the weak s-process.},

Photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial stars experiments. (Abridged) We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is significantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium. In particular we show that the main density peak of UMi is off-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and it shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales, as opposite to Draco, which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass to light (M/L) ratio of this galaxy may be as low as M/L {\~{}} 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.},

@article{Rizzi07,
abstract = {A large multicolour, wide-field photometric database of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been analysed using three different methods to provide revised distance estimates based on stellar populations in different age intervals. The distance to Fornax was obtained from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch measured by a new method, and using the luminosity of Horizontal Branch stars and Red Clump stars correc ted for stellar population effects. Assuming a reddening {\$}E(B-V)=0.02{\$}, the following distance moduli were derived: {\$}(m-M){\_}0=20.71 \backslashpm 0.07{\$} based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch, {\$}(m-M){\_}0=20.72 \backslashpm 0.06{\$} from the level of the Horizontal Branch, and {\$}(m-M){\_}0=20.73 \backslashpm 0.09{\$} using the Red Clump method. The weighted mean distance modulus to Fornax is {\$}(m-M){\_}0=20.72 \backslashpm 0.04{\$}. All these measurements agree within the errors, and are fully consistent with previous determinations and with the distance measurements obtained in a companion paper from near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams.},
