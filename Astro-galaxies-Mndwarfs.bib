abstract = {We present the results of a dedicated search for extremely metal-poor stars in the Fornax, Sculptor and Sextans dSphs. Five stars were selected from two earlier VLT/Giraffe and HET/HRS surveys and subsequently followed up at high spectroscopic resolution with VLT/UVES. All of them turned out to have [Fe/H] {\textless}= -3 and three stars are below [Fe/H] -3.5. This constitutes the first evidence that the classical dSphs Fornax and Sextans join Sculptor in containing extremely metal-poor stars and suggests that all of the classical dSphs contain extremely metal-poor stars. One giant in Sculptor at [Fe/H]=-3.96 +- 0.10 is the most metal-poor star ever observed in an external galaxy. We carried out a detailed analysis of the chemical abundances of the alpha, iron peak, and the heavy elements, and we performed a comparison with the Milky Way halo and the ultra faint dwarf stellar populations. Carbon, barium and strontium show distinct features characterized by the early stages of galaxy formation and can constrain the origin of their nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {A longstanding problem is identifying the elusive progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which can roughly be split into Chandraksekhar and sub-Chandrasekhar mass events. An important difference between these two cases is the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess in Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high central density. From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the chemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity, low-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include C/Fe, {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced by Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or Pair-Instsability supernovae. Strong deficiencies of Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe also suggest the absence of alpha-rich freeze-out nucleosynthesis, favoring low-mass WD progenitor SNe Ia. Based on comparisons of the measured Mn/Fe and Si/Fe ratios with detonation models, we estimate a WD mass near 0.95Msun. We also compare Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios to the recent theoretical yields predicted by Shen et al., finding consistent results. To explain the COS 171 [Fe/H], at -1.35 dex, requires dilution of the ejecta from a single SNIa event with {\~{}}10{\^{}}4 Msun of material; this is expected for a SN Ia remnant expanding into a warm interstellar medium with n{\~{}}1 /cm{\^{}}3. In the future, finding more stars with the unique chemical signatures we highlight here will be important for constraining the rate and environments of sub-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Context. Manganese is predominantly synthesised in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive thermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass (M Ch) white dwarfs (WDs) are predicted to produce Mn-to-Fe ratios that significantly exceed those of SN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current supernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-M Ch WDs produce [Mn/Fe] 0.0. Aims. Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia scenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding near-M Ch to sub-M Ch primary WDs in the Galaxy. Methods. We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear supernova simulations that refer to different initial setups and progenitor channels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the solar neighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of the considered explosion models. Results. We find that due to the entropy dependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe] depends strongly on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-M Ch WDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-M Ch WDs. Of all nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of Mn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of near-M Ch WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe]. Consequently, we find in our chemical evolution calculations that the observed [Mn/Fe] in the solar neighborhood at [Fe/H] 0.0 cannot be reproduced without near-M Ch SN Ia primaries. Assuming that 50{\%} of all SNe Ia stem from explosive thermonuclear burning in near-M Ch WDs results in a good match to data.},

abstract = {We refine our previously introduced parameterized model for explosive carbon-oxygen fusion during thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia) by adding corrections to post-processing of recorded Lagrangian fluid element histories to obtain more accurate isotopic yields. Deflagration and detonation products are verified for propagation in a uniform density medium. A new method is introduced for reconstructing the temperature-density history within the artificially thick model deflagration front. We obtain better than 5$\backslash${\%} consistency between the electron capture computed by the burning model and yields from post-processing. For detonations, we compare to a benchmark calculation of the structure of driven steady-state planar detonations performed with a large nuclear reaction network and error-controlled integration. We verify that, for steady-state planar detonations down to a density of 5x10{\^{}}6 g/cc, our post processing matches the major abundances in the benchmark solution typically to better than 10{\%} for times greater than 0.01 s after the shock front passage. As a test case to demonstrate the method, presented here with post-processing for the first time, we perform a two dimensional simulation of a SN Ia in the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration-detonation transition (DDT) scenario. We find that reconstruction of deflagration tracks leads to slightly more complete silicon burning than without reconstruction. The resulting abundance structure of the ejecta is consistent with inferences from spectroscopic studies of observed SNe Ia. We confirm the absence of a central region of stable Fe-group material for the multi-dimensional DDT scenario. Detailed isotopic yields are tabulated and only change modestly when using deflagration reconstruction.},

abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure and evolution of both the Sun and our solar system. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from LTE whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

abstract = {Barium stars are optimal sites for studying the correlations between the neutron-capture elements and other species that may be depleted or enhanced, because they act as neutron seeds or poisons during the operation of the s-process. These data are necessary to help constrain the modeling of the neutron-capture paths and explain the s-process abundance curve of the solar system. Chemical abundances for a large number of barium stars with different degrees of s-process excesses, masses, metallicities, and evolutionary states are a crucial step towards this goal. We present abundances of Mn, Cu, Zn, and various light and heavy elements for a sample of barium and normal giant stars, and present correlations between abundances contributed to different degrees by the weak-s, mains , and r-processes of neutron capture, between Fe-peak elements and heavy elements. Data from the literature are also considered in order to better study the abundance pattern of peculiar stars. The stellar spectra were observed with FEROS/ESO. The stellar atmospheric parameters of the eight barium giant stars and six normal giants that we analyzed lie in the range 4300 {\textless} T eff /K {\textless} 5300, −0.7 {\textless} [Fe/H] ≤ 0.12 and 1.5 ≤ log g {\textless} 2.9. Carbon and nitrogen abundances were derived by spectral synthesis of the molecular bands of C 2 , CH, and CN. For all other elements we used the atomic lines to perform the spectral synthesis. A very large scatter was found mainly for the Mn abundances when data from the literature were considered. We found that [Zn/Fe] correlates well with the heavy element excesses, its abundance clearly increasing as the heavy element excesses increase, a trend not shown by the [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also, the ratios involving Mn, Cu, and Zn and heavy elements usually show an increasing trend toward higher metallicities. Our results suggest that a larger fraction of the Zn synthesis than of Cu is owed to massive stars, and that the contribution of the mains process to the synthesis of both elements is small. We also conclude that Mn is mostly synthesized by SN Ia, and that a non-negligible fraction of the synthesis of Mn, Cu, and Zn is owed to the weak s-process.},

We add to the MODS sample C and N measurements for 35 additional stars belonging to the blue RGB sequence, presented in Lardo et al. (2012). We find a clear separation between the two groups of stars in s-process elements as well as C and N content. Both groups display a C-N anti-correlation and the red RGB stars are on average richer in C and N with respect to the blue RGB.

abstract = {Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were discovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are relatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause white dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single and/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions have different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar mass explosions.Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic chemical signatures.Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected to be rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker metallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution of metal-poor systems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor.Results. The model predicts a butterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity and – at the same time – a decrease of [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than in the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed abundances in stars of Ursa Minor.Conclusions. The surprising agreement between our models and available observations provides a strong indication of the origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia. This outcome requires confirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in stars of other satellite galaxies of our Milky Way. It will be vital for this project to measure not the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the opposite; the metal-rich end of dwarf spheroidals.},

abstract = {We have used UVES on VLT-UT2 to take spectra of 15 red giants in the Sculptor, Fornax, Carina and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We measure the abundances of alpha, iron peak, s and r-process elements. No dSph giants in our sample show the deep mixing abundance pattern seen in nearly all globular clusters. At a given metallicity, the dSph giants exhibit lower [el/Fe] abundance ratios for the alpha elements than stars in the Galactic halo. This can be caused by a slow star formation rate and contribution from Type Ia SN, and/or a small star formation event (low total mass) and mass dependent Type II SN yields. Differences in the even-Z [el/Fe] ratios between these galaxies, as well as differences in the evolution of the s{\&}r-process elements are interpreted in terms of their star formation histories. Comparison of the dSph abundances with those of the Galactic halo reveals some consistencies. In particular, we find stars that mimic the abundance pattern found by Nissen {\&} Shuster (1997) for metal-rich, high R{\_}max, high z{\_}max halo stars, supporting their suggestion that disrupted dSph's may explain up to 50{\%} of the metal-rich halo. A comparison with the metal-poor Galactic halo reveal no consistencies suggesting that the majority of the metal-poor Galactic halo could not have been formed from objects similar to these dSph. Finally, we use the dSph abundances to place new constraints on the nucleosynthetic origins, including Cu and Mn which are more consistent with metallicity dependent SN yields than the more commonly assumed SN Ia production.},

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

abstract = {We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in Chandrasekhar mass models for Type Ia Supernovae(SNe Ia) to obtain new constraints on the rate of matter accretion onto the progenitor white dwarf and on the ignition density of central carbon deflagration. The calculated abundance of the Fe-group neutron-rich nuclei is highly sensitive to the electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields obtained from a slow central deflagration, and from a fast deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. We found that (1) to avoid too large ratios of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}54{\}}{\$}Cr/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Fe and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}50{\}}{\$}Ti/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Fe, the ignition density should be as low as $\backslash$ltsim 2 $\backslash$e9 $\backslash$gmc, and that (2) to avoid the overproduction of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}58{\}}{\$}Ni and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}54{\}}{\$}Fe, either the flame speed should not exceed a few {\%} of the sound speed in the central low {\$}Y{\_}e{\$} layers, or the progenitor star has to be metal-poor compared with solar. Such low central densities can be realized by a rapid accretion as fast as {\$}\backslashdot M{\$} $\backslash$gtsim 1 {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-7{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. In order to reproduce the solar abundance of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}48{\}}{\$}Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that undergo ignition at higher densities. We also found that the total amount of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Ni, the Si-Ca/Fe ratio, and the abundance of elements like Mn and Cr (incomplete Si-burning ashes), depend on the density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed detonations.

abstract = {We present (V,I) photometry of two wide ({\~{}}25 X 25 arcmin{\^{}}2) fields centered on the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Ursa Minor. New estimates of the distance to these galaxies are provided ((m-M){\_}0(UMi)=19.41 $\backslash$pm 0.12 and (m-M){\_}0(Dra)=19.84 $\backslash$pm 0.14) and a comparative study of their evolved stellar population is presented. We detect for the first time the RGB-bump in the Luminosity Function of UMi (V{\_}{\{}RGB{\}}{\^{}}{\{}Bump{\}}=19.40$\backslash$pm 0.06) while the feature is not detected in Draco. Photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial stars experiments. (Abridged) We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is significantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium. In particular we show that the main density peak of UMi is off-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and it shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales, as opposite to Draco, which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass to light (M/L) ratio of this galaxy may be as low as M/L {\~{}} 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.},

abstract = {The explosion energy of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is derived from the difference in nuclear binding energy liberated in the explosive fusion of light " fuel " nuclei, predominantly carbon and oxygen, into more tightly bound nu-clear " ash " dominated by iron and silicon group elements. The very same explosive thermonuclear fusion event is also one of the major processes contributing to the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements, in particular the iron-group elements. For example, most of the iron and manganese in the Sun and its planetary system was produced in thermonuclear supernovae. Here, we review the physics of explosive thermonuclear burning in carbon-oxygen white dwarf material and the methodolo-gies utilized in calculating predicted nucleosynthesis from hydrodynamic explosion models. While the dominant explosion scenario remains unclear, many aspects of the nuclear combustion and nucleosynthesis are common to all models and must occur in some form in order to produce the observed yields. We summarize the predicted nucleosynthetic yields for existing explosions models, placing particular emphasis on characteristic differences in the nucleosynthetic signatures of the dif-ferent suggested scenarios leading to Type Ia supernovae. Following this, we discuss how these signatures compare with observations of several individual supernovae, remnants, and the composition of material in our Galaxy and galaxy clusters.},

Parameter ranges are: Teff=2500 to 8000 K, log g =log(GM/R2)= -1 to 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, [Me/H]=-5 to +1, with [Alpha/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances to also represent stars of types R, S and N, and with microturbulence parameters from 1 to 5 km/s. We also list fluxes in approximately 108,000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification include hydrostatic equilibrium, MLT convection and LTE. A number of general properties of the models are discussed, in relation to the effects of changing blanketing and sphericity. Models are compared with other available grids and excellent agreement is found with plane-parallel models of Castelli and Kurucz within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are departures from the spherically symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying. The models of the grid show regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested rules of thumb concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and found them to often be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

The volume and density of the white dwarf increase during slow subsonic burning, and this burning is transformed when certain critical conditions are met. The scenario is simulated numerically to give results of the gasdynamical event: all C-O fuel is burned; intermediate mass elements are produced in the outer layers; and approximately 1 solar mass or more of Fe-peak elements is produced during a delayed detonation. The results are compared to both detonation and deflagration models to consider the velocities of intermediate mass elements and of Fe-peak elements. The ratios obtained in the models are similar to those found in the solar neighborhood, and the detonation is shown to occur at low densities.},

@article{Timmes03,
abstract = {We explore the idea that the observed variations in the peak luminosities of Type Ia supernovae originate in part from a scatter in metallicity of the main-sequence stars that become white dwarfs. Previous, numerical, studies have not self-consistently explored metallicities greater than solar. One-dimensional Chandrasekhar mass models of SNe Ia produce most of their 56Ni in a burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium between the mass shells 0.2 and 0.8 solar masses, for which the electron to nucleon ratio is constant during the burn. We show analytically that, under these conditions, charge and mass conservation constrain the mass of 56Ni produced to depend linearly on the original metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor. Detailed post-processing of W7-like models confirms this linear dependence. The effect that we identify is most evident at metallicities larger than solar, and is in agreement with previous self-consistent calculations over the metallicity range common to both calculations. The observed scatter in the metallicity (1/3--3 times solar) of the solar neighborhood is enough to induce a 25{\%} variation in the mass of 56Ni ejected by Type Ia supernovae. This is sufficient to vary the peak V-band brightness by approximately 0.2. This scatter in metallicity is present out to the limiting redshifts of current observations (z {\textless} 1). Sedimentation of 22Ne can possibly amplify the variation in 56Ni mass up to 50{\%}. Further numerical studies can determine if other metallicity-induced effects, such as a change in the mass of the 56Ni-producing region, offset or enhance this variation.},

abstract = {In the "double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar" model for type Ia supernovae, a carbon-oxygen (C + O) white dwarf accumulates sufficient amounts of helium such that a detonation ignites in that layer before the Chandrasekhar mass is reached. This detonation is thought to trigger a secondary detonation in the C + O core. By means of one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-M{\_}sun models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in numerical simulations is analyzed. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell masses of 0.2 and 0.1 M{\_}sun, we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete evolution of three selected models with 0.2 M{\_}sun of He through the C/O-detonation phase and obtain nickel-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M{\_}sun. Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta features significant amounts of nickel in the outer layers at high expansion velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra. (abbreviated)},

abstract = {We present measurements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti abundances for 388 radial velocity member stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), a satellite of the Milky Way. This is the largest sample of individual alpha element (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 A, R {\~{}} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R {\textgreater}{\~{}} 20000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties of sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.14 and sigma([alpha/Fe]) = 0.13. The Sculptor [Fe/H] distribution has a mean {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2 than the Milky Way halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 +/- 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except the Milky Way halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [alpha/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H] increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\~{}} -1.5) have lower [alpha/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 +/- 0.003 dex per arcmin in [Fe/H] and +0.013 +/- 0.003 dex per arcmin in [alpha/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc). Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor tail of the Galactic halo formed.},

To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know, and what we still do not know, about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.},

abstract = {We present our analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) observations in F555W ({\~{}}V) and F814W ({\~{}}I) of the central region of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The V versus V-I color-magnitude diagram features a sparsely populated blue horizontal branch, a steep thin red giant branch, and a narrow subgiant branch. The main sequence reaches {\~{}}2 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff (V{\_}TO {\~{}} 23.27 +- 0.11 mag) of the median stellar population. We compare the fiducial sequence of Ursa Minor with the fiducial sequence of the Galactic globular cluster M92 (NGC 6341). The excellent match between Ursa Minor and M92 confirms that the median stellar population of the UMi dSph galaxy is metal poor ([Fe/H]{\_}UMi {\~{}} [Fe/H]{\_}M92 {\~{}} -2.2 dex) and ancient (age{\_}UMi {\~{}} age{\_}M92 {\~{}} 14 Gyr). The B-V reddening and the absorption in V are estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.03 +- 0.01 mag and A{\_}V = 0.09 +- 0.03 mag. A new estimate of the distance modulus of Ursa Minor, (m-M){\_}0 = 19.18 +- 0.12 mag, has been derived based on fiducial-sequence fitting with M92 and the adoption of the apparent V distance modulus for M92 of (m-M){\_}V = 14.67 +- 0.08 mag (Pont et al. 1998, A{\&}A, 329, 87). These HST observations indicate that Ursa Minor has had a very simple star formation history consisting mainly of a single major burst of star formation about 14 Gyr ago which lasted {\textless}=2 Gyr. If the ancient Galactic globular clusters, like M92, formed concurrently with the early formation of the Milky Way galaxy itself, then the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal is probably as old as the Milky Way.},

abstract = {We present new nucleosynthesis yields as functions of the stellar mass, metallicity, and explosion energy (corresponding to normal supernovae and hypernovae). We apply the results to the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood. Our new yields are based on the new developments in the observational/theoretical studies of supernovae (SNe) and extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the halo, which have provided excellent opportunities to test the explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. We use the light curve and spectra fitting of individual SN to estimate the mass of the progenitor, explosion energy, and produced 56Ni mass. Comparison with the abundance patterns of EMP stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters of core-collapse SNe, such as mixing-fallback parameters. More specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes of massive SNe: (1) very energetic hypernovae, whose kinetic energy (KE) is more than 10 times the KE of normal core-collapse SNe, and (2) very faint and low energy SNe (faint SNe). These two new classes of SNe are likely to be “black-hole-forming” SNe with rotating or non-rotating black holes. Nucleosynthesis in hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios (Zn,Co,V,Ti)/Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr)/Fe than normal SNe, which can explain the observed trends of these ratios in EMP stars. Nucleosynthesis in faint SNe is characterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundance pattern of the most Fe-poor stars. These comparisons suggest that black-hole-forming SNe made important contributions to the early galactic (and cosmic) chemical evolution. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prior to the explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a Type Ia supernova there is a long "simmering," during which the 12C + 12C reaction gradually heats the white dwarf on a long ({\~{}} 1000 yr) timescale. Piro {\&} Bildsten showed that weak reactions during this simmering set a maximum electron abundance Ye at the time of the explosion. We investigate the nuclear reactions during this simmering with a series of self-heating, at constant pressure, reaction network calculations. Unlike in AGB stars, proton captures onto 22Ne and heavier trace nuclei do not play a significant role. The 12C abundance is sufficiently high that the neutrons preferentially capture onto 12C, rather than iron group nuclei. As an aid to hydrodynamical simulations of the simmering phase, we present fits to the rates of heating, electron capture, change in mean atomic mass, and consumption of 12C in terms of the screened thermally averaged cross section for 12C + 12C. Our evaluation of the net heating rate includes contributions from electron captures into the 3.68 MeV excited state of 13C. This results in a slightly larger energy release, per 12C consumed, than that found by Piro {\&} Bildsten, but less than that released for a burn to only 20Ne and 23Na. We compare our one-zone results to more accurate integrations over the white dwarf structure to estimate the amount of 12C that must be consumed to raise the white dwarf temperature, and hence to determine the net reduction of Ye during simmering.},

abstract = {We present the chemical analysis of 49 giant stars of the globular cluster NGC 2419, using medium resolution spectra collected with the multi-object spectrograph DEIMOS@Keck. Previous analysis of this cluster revealed a large dispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II triplet, suggesting an intrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we assess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is detected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ∼40 per cent of the observed targets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ∼ −1 dex, a level of Mg deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the large dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed dispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously interpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant role in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor. A strong depletion in the Mg abundance leads to an increase of the line strength of the Ca II triplet, due to the variation in the electronic pressure, at a constant Fe and Ca abundance. Finally, we detect an anti-correlation between Mg and K abundances, not easily explainable within the framework of the current nucleosynthesis models.},

abstract = {We provide manganese abundances (corrected for the effect of the hyperfine structure) for a large number of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, and for a smaller number in the Carina and Sextans dSph galaxies. Abundances had already been determined for a number of other elements in these galaxies, including $\alpha$ and iron-peak ones, which allowed us to build [Mn/Fe] and [Mn/$\alpha$] versus [Fe/H] diagrams. The Mn abundances imply sub-solar [Mn/Fe] ratios for the stars in all four galaxies examined. In Sculptor, [Mn/Fe] stays roughly constant between [Fe/H] ∼ −1.8 and −1.4 and decreases at higher iron abundance. In Fornax, [Mn/Fe] does not vary in any significant way with [Fe/H]. The relation between [Mn/$\alpha$] and [Fe/H] for the dSph galaxies is clearly systematically offset from that for the Milky Way, which reflects the different star formation histories of the respective galaxies. The [Mn/$\alpha$] behavior can be interpreted as a result of the metal-dependent Mn yields of Type II and Type Ia supernovae. We also computed chemical evolution models for star formation histories matching those determined empirically for Sculptor, Fornax, and Carina, and for the Mn yields of SNe Ia, which were assumed to be either constant or variable with metallicity. The observed [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in Sculptor, Fornax, and Carina can be reproduced only by the chemical evolution models that include a metallicity-dependent Mn yield from the SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Recent observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have shown diversified properties of the explosion strength, light curves and chemical composition. To investigate possible origins of such diversities in SNe Ia, we have presented multi-dimensional hydrodynamical study of explosions and associated nucleosynthesis in the near Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) for wide parameters (Leung and Nomoto 2018 ApJ). In the present paper, we extend our wide parameter survey of models to the explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WDs. We take the double detonation model for the explosion mechanism. The model parameters of the survey include metallicity of {\$}Z = 0 - 5{\$} {\$}Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, the mass of the CO WD progenitor of {\$}M = 0.90 - 1.20{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, the He envelope mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm He{\}} = 0.05 - 0.20{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We also study how the initial He detonation configuration affects the triggering of the C detonation. For these parameters, we first derive the minimum He envelope mass necessary to trigger the C detonation. We then examine how the explosion dynamics and associated nucleosynthesis depend on these parameters, and compare our results with the previous representative models. We compare our nucleosynthesis yields with the unusual abundance patterns of Fe-peak elements and isotopes observed in SNe Ia 2011fe, 2012cg, 2014J, and SN Ia remnant 3C 397 to provide constraints on their progenitors and environments. We provide the nucleosynthesis yields table of the sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions, to discuss their roles in the galactic chemical evolution and archaeology.},

@article{Kirby15,
abstract = {We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L{\_}sun) {\~{}}= 1.6, which can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform. Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] {\textless} +1 in dSphs follow a different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the metallicity of the [C/Fe] "knee" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe] distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.},

abstract = {Aims. Following our solar work, we perform NLTE calculations of the Mn abundance for fourteen stars with [Fe/H] from 0 to –2.5, mainly to show how NLTE affects Mn abundances in cool stars of different metallicities.Methods. The spectrum synthesis and Mn abundances are based on statistical equilibrium calculations using various estimates for the influence of hydrogen collisions.Results. The NLTE abundances of Mn in all studied stars are systematically higher than the LTE abundances. At low metallicities, the NLTE abundance corrections may run up to 0.5–0.7 dex. Instead of a strong depletion of Mn relative to Fe in metal-poor stars as found by the other authors, we only find slightly subsolar values of [Mn/Fe] throughout the range of metallicities analyzed here.Conclusions. The [Mn/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars is inconsistent with the predictions of galactic chemical evolution models, where Mn is less produced than Fe.},
